# effect_of_DLL_on_spanish_literacy_skills

This repo is about exploring the effect of DLL literacy program on the Spanish literacy skills of the Spanish-speaking first graders who have weak literacy skills. I used the data collected by a randomized controlled trial and generated 2 groups: a control group that received the regular teaching, and a treatment group that received the DLL training. The sample is 152 Spanish-speaking students whose IdO scores were within the lowest 25% of their schools. I visualized the differences in posttest scores between these 2 groups using the clean data, and I fitted a linear mixed model for each posttest score to explore the effect of DLL on Spanish literacy skills. The analysis and paper are created in a fully reproducible way.

**Key findings** 

The students who receiving the DLL training tended to achieve higher posttest scores than those who receiving the regular teaching on average, so DLL program can improve the Spanish literacy skills of the enrolled students.
